# Hobbies

## Football/soccer
- Fell in love with the sport when I played my first game in 4th grade, and 
never stopped playing since.
- Now, I come out most weekends for pickup soccer and small tournaments in the
Hamilton area.

## Skateboarding
- In the summer of 2019, a friend gave me his skateboard so I didn't have to
walk to lectures
- I started skateboarding everyday. The small injuries, recoveries, and the joy
of learning new tricks have changed me in ways I could never have imagined
