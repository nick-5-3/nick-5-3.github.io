## Academic 

### Towing Vehicle
- Effectively collaborated with 4 team members to design a vehicle to tow a 
given load, provided the propulsion system does not use wheels
- The design's final report can be found [here](/assets/files/Tow Vehicle Report.pdf)
- Designed a 3D-printed spoke on Autodesk Inventor and conducted finite
element analysis on the model to simulate operating stresses
- Made design changes based on FEA to increase safety factor of spoke design by 
over 3 times
- Created a dynamic simulation to simulate the vehicle's propulsion system

### Human-Powered Generator
- Designed a device to transfer power from a human operator to a generator
- Implemented a piston mechanism and a 1:625 ratio gearbox to accomplish the 
task
- Performed a [DFMA analysis](/assets/files/DFMA 2.pdf) on the design
