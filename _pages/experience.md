## Professional/Extracurricular

### McMaster Rocketry Team
The McMaster Rocketry Team is a student-led technical team that aims to compete
in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC). Before 2018, the
team assembled a complete rocket body, but had not been able to integrate the 
systems. In 2019, we decided to start from the ground up with
smaller models aiming to test and perfectly implement its control systems before 
making the G-class rocket, with the goal of competing in 2021.

- Led the structural team to design and construct C-class rocket models
- Modeled and constructed FE stress analyses on multiple versions using Autodesk
Fusion 360 and Solidworks
- Created technical drawings of parts in accordance with ASME Y14.5 GD&T standards
- Improved rocket efficiency by reducing the weight of 3D printed parts by 40% 
- Set up a simulation of the design using Simulink and thrust data provided by
the motor manufacturer, Estes
- Currently attempting to implement a 3D printed thrust vectoring system for 
the C-class rocket

### McMaster Mars Rover Team
The McMaster Mars Rover Team is also a student-led team with the goal of making
a Mars Rover prototype to compete in Canadian International Rover Challenge
(CIRC). The team is working on a wooden Mars Rover prototype and making changes
to seamlessly combine subsystems. I joined the mechanical team in September 2019 
to help build the wooden prototype.

- Designed and developed more stable chassis for the prototype
- Used the bandsaw, drill press, and hand tools to accurately and quickly 
manufacture parts based on technical drawings
- Collaborated heavily with team members on the GrabCAD platform to update the 
design
- Spent over 30 hours in the McMaster Hatch machine shop to work on the build

## Volunteering

### Ontario Rover Rally
The Ontario Rover Rally is an annual event starting July 2019. The event, 
created by McMaster Mars Rover team members, is meant to provide rover teams 
with a fun day to test their rovers before participating in the CIRC as well as 
to generate excitement for Mars exploration. Find out more about the event
[here](https://macmarsrover.wixsite.com/ontarioroverrally/challenges). I worked
with the organizing team from May 2019 through July 2019.

University, York University, University of Toronto, and HotPopRobot</figcaption>
</figure>

- Helped raise funds and obtain event swag through maintaining contact with 
3 main sponsors
- Made purchases and managed small-scale logistics to make sure the event runs
smoothly
- Worked 12 hours a day for 2 weeks in the McMaster Thode Makerspace to construct
an obstacle course for the Rover race from recycled wooden pallets

### Adam Pham Campaign
From January 2018 to May 2018, I volunteered to canvass for Adam Pham, who was 
campaigning in the Parkdale-High Park region.

- Canvassed over 100 households in the area to convince voters and obtain
population data
- Maintained professional composure in harsh weather to communicate effectively
with voters 
- Coordinated with 30 other volunteers to quickly survey the area
