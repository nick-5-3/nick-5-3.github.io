## Academic 

### Towing Vehicle
- Effectively collaborated with 4 team members to design a vehicle to tow a 
given load, provided the propulsion system does not use wheels
- The design's final report can be found [here](/assets/files/Tow Vehicle Report.pdf)
- Designed a 3D-printed spoke on Autodesk Inventor and conducted finite
element analysis on the model to simulate operating stresses
- Made design changes based on FEA to increase part strength by over 3 times
- Created a dynamic simulation to simulate the vehicle's propulsion system

### Human-Powered Generator
- Designed a device to transfer power from a human operator to a generator
- Implemented a piston mechanism and a 1:625 ratio gearbox to accomplish the 
task
- Performed a [DFMA analysis](/assets/files/DFMA 2.pdf) on the design

### Prosthetic Hand Prototype
- Designed a 3D printed, easily assembled prosthetic hand prototype to move 2 
fingers at a given speed using a reduction gear box attached to a motor
- Designed components to snap onto each other, requiring less fasteners

## Personal

### Self-Inserting Catheter
- Received 3rd place overall in the McMaster Designathon 2020
- With 3 group members, came up with the idea for a semi-automatic 
implementation of the Seldinger technique

### Sumobot
- Design, built and programmed an autonomous sumo robot, combining 3D 
printed parts, an ultrasonic sensor, line sensors, and an Arduino Uno

### Model Aircraft
- Made a foam model airplane from household materials
- Implemented full control surfaces and attached propeller and electronics
- Made a big mistake and realized that the connector from my LiPo battery is an 
XT60 connector, and does not match with the connector from the ESC I purchased 
(oops D: )
